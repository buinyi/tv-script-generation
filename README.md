# TV Script Generation
This is project 3 for [Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101).

The RNN is used to generate a new text script after learning from the text of one episode from Simpsons. 

Implemented in the ipython notebook:
   - RNN with LSTM layers in TensorFlow
   - Hyperparameters selection
   - Code for saving results to TensorBoard
